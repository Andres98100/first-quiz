## System Security 

To solve the question, I will demonstrate my knowledge of security bes practices. I will use OWASP Top 10 of 2021 as a guide to identify securiry issues that could be a problem for a new and exciting tech startup that installs solar panels through an app

## OWASP 10 

The OWASP Top 10 is a list of the ten most critical security risks for web and mobile applications. I will use this list to identify security issues that could affect my application

The following are the security issues I would look for to make my system secure: 

* A01:2021: Improper Access Control: Ensure that only authorized individuals have access to my system and my customers' data. This means implementing strong access controls, such as the use of user-based roles and permissions

* A02:2021: Sensitive Data Exposure: Use strong encryption algorithms to protect data at rest and in transit. This includes encrypting customer passwords and order information

* A03:2021: Implement mechanisms to prevent injection attacks, such as the use of prepared statements and parameterized queries in my database queries

* A04:2021: Insecure Design: Design my system with security in mind. This means avoiding insecure practices, such as storing passwords in plaintext and using weak cryptographic algorithms

* A05:2021: Insecure Deserialization: Ensure that my system is configured securely. This includes things like using strong passwords for user accounts and regularly updating software

* A06:2021: Vulnerable and Outdated Components: Use updated and maintained components. This means regularly updating my software and patching known vulnerabilities

* A07:2021: Identification and Authentication Failures: Use strong authentication mechanisms to identify and authenticate users. This includes the use of two-factor authentication and one-time password (TOTP)

* A08:2021: Lack of Application Layer Controls: Monitor my system for potential attacks and fraud. This means logging all system activity and reviewing logs regularly

* A09:2021: Security Misconfiguration: Store data securely. This means encrypting sensitive data and using secure storage for customer passwords

* A10:2021: Components with Known Vulnerabilities: Implement mechanisms to manage sessions securely. This includes things like using session tokens and invalidating sessions when they are no longer needed

In this way I ensure application security by addressing the most critical security risks
